Coconut currency anyone? John Frum?\r\n\r\nLearn the secret lost in the Garden of Eden that money grows on trees. It is the secret hidden from us by the serpent viper money changers. Learn how to destroy all fiat currency and turn it into gods money. Time, technology and resource based currencies.\r\n\r\nLearn how you can convert your fiat currency into food based currency thus returning the fiat to the bankers who printed it and leaving you with an actual valuable commodity to spend into the economy.\r\n\r\nIts simple you purchase a bag of grain from a local producer only they agree to store it for you and you get the receipt to trade for other goods or services. Now you have a pure resource based currency. It has more intrinsic value than fiat as it can be eaten. \r\n\r\nThe receipt for the goods must be claimed by a certain date to be valid as the product has a shelf life and the grower storing the grain has to pay for storage. The receipt has the value of the grain paid in dollars and denotes the weight the receipt is good for.\r\nThe receipt can be traded for the fiat currency value or the weight value.\r\n\r\nIn this way any agricultural community can regain control of their money supply.\r\n\r\nMay peace be with you,\r\nJoshua",

We will start to gather at 11pm after the regional burn and begin the performance at 11:59pm Thur 8-29, creating the first Midnight Mass Windphony, ever in the history of humankind! \r\n\r\nThe plan is to create a human / color-light & sound vibrational bridge connecting the Man, the Temple and Way Beyond (what ever that means for you) through a vibrational alignment of individual players. We are inviting conscious hoopers, fire dancers and any other  \"instruments of mass creation\" to sync up with this vibrational field of PEACE & LOVE. This is the only pre-requisite for BAND Members, as we open a \"Quantum Portal\" bridging our highest potential, creating a \"morphogenic field,\" reaching inter-dimensionally through time and space, connecting all those attuned to this vibrational field.\r\n\r\nCome and Play...even if you are not on the Playa, join us on a vibrational level...and if you do make it, ONLY COME IF YOU CAN HOLD A POSITIVE THOUGHT OF LOVE AND PEACE! We will create a cosmic \"string of pearls\" that will produce a universal ripple...reaching Eternity ItSelf! This IS Cult Cargo at its finest, with only our highest and best intentions in mind, as we collectively \"reach out and touch some ONES...\" And if the time and space permits...maybe, just maybe, the recipients of our Mass Windphony will come and  join us in this 3rd dimensional reality... with the veils already thinned  through the very spirit of Burning man...anything is possible! \r\n\r\nCome Play in the Band and help create this cosmic wave...\r\n\r\nRegister at https://www.facebook.com/windsingerX and if you want to be part of the Windphony. Bring a Windsinger, or let us know if you want to own an instrument of your own, as part of our non-profit Windsinger Xperience!",

Bribery and foolishness are considered de rigueur.\r\n\r\nAll that is necessary is that you have some form of facial hair, a \r\ngood and jolly spirit, and the necessary accoutrement of a cummerbund. One must have the proper air of formality around such an event as this, do not you agree?\"",

She has had a life-long love affair with music and dance - they are her spiritual practice and her most potent passions. ALIA transmits the bliss she experiences in performances to create a connected, alive and activated experience that evokes the sacred and awakens our connection to our source through rhythm and movement. She approaches every set as a ritual and as a facilitator of dance floor unity. ALIA has shared the stage with the likes of Beats Antique, Random Rab, Govinda, Freq Nasty, Marty Party, An-ten-nae, Heyoka, Pussymonster, Sasha Rose, Vibesquad, DJ Jocelyn, and Bay Area favorite DJ Dragonfly.

The purpose is to bring us back to our most natural state of being, with the desert environment and red hands symbolizing life and death, love and hate. The more participants the better, helping to create a unifying and liberating experience which will be documented with photography and film, to be posted on the website Bodypaintography.com. Look for flags with Red Hands and buckets that need help filling! Lets make this gathering impressive and expressive together! Don’t forget to bring water for hydration.\r\nWhen: The happening takes place 3pm dusting preparation, 5 pm documenting the outcome.\r\nWhere:  Meet near the Temple…look for the flags with Red Hands!",

If you're interested in learning more about how to please your man orally, this is the place for you.\r\n\r\nCome on ladies / givers, you know you've got some skills - and some questions!  Come share your favorite tips and techniques by words and demonstration, and ask questions that have been plaguing you.\r\n\r\n\t* Drool or dry? \r\n\t* What about the gag reflex?\r\n\t* How do you use hands and still go deep?\r\n\r\nAnd guys, you must have comments you'd like to pass on, other than simply \"Yes, please\"!\r\n\r\n\t* Hate teeth?  Want teeth?\r\n\t* What about deep throat?\r\n\r\nHere's your chance to make your requests - and pet peeves - heard!\r\n\r\nThis is a participatory event open to couples of any combination, so long as one of them has some phallic protuberance and the other is applying lips, tongue, and maybe even throat to it.  No lookie-loos!\r\nThis was a great fun event at the last Burn.  The presenter's been researching all year to find new tidbits and info to share.  (Hey, someone's gotta do the tough jobs.)

The Burning Man event, like no other environment in the world, has created a unique venue for art, and has rekindled one of art’s most valuable functions: connecting community members in creation, curiosity, and wonderment. At Burning Man, we observe how art brings people together, inspires participation and engenders meaningful connections between individuals. The art experienced at Burning Man invites individuals to interact with both the work itself and with their community at large.\r\n\r\nBRAF was established to bring this modality of creating and coexisting with art to the rest of the world, with the vision that community-driven, inclusive, and interactive art is vital to a thriving culture. The foundation received its 501(c)3 status in November of 2001. Come learn more and see how  you can get involved.",

Deliver 2000 flyers and get much schwagg. -------\r\n\r\nYes,  Bobby Wheelock has finally worked out how to give back to every participant on the playa.  This will encompass delivering 64,000 unique flyers to everyone.  And we need YOU to help. --------\r\n\r\nUpon taking this great privilege,  you will zig zag down the streets and give flyers to all participants - and these are not your normal flyers.  Each one is different, unique, and special.  There are jokes, puzzles, games, gags, and coupons, and ultimately a higher purpose - to make sure every burner gets the true value of decommodification.  These flyers are also very well organized so as to tell  participants everything they need to know - their new Playa name, color, home planet and more!\r\n------\r\nTo participate,  Please wait at your most convenient corner on the outlying road of Laissez-faire on wednesday morning, and look for the mutant vehicle with a big Z on it. \r\nWe will provide you with a bag full of a chunk of flyers, a map with directions, a official postal cap, and a second bag so you can collect all the gifts that are Deserved to you by the populace of Burning Man for your amazing volunteer effort.  The routes will be back and forth from each 1/2 hour street, moving inward from Laissez-faire to the Esplanade.\r\n------\r\nHelp us with this amazing performance art project.  Help us ensure that Decommodification stays as a true principal!\r\n------\r\nWho is Bobby Wheelock?\r\n\r\nBobby is one of the earliest human clones.   Born in 1970,  he is duplicated from the DNA of a prominent German political leader.  That being said,  Bobby has veered away from his \"father's\" ways and wishes to bring love joy to the burning man community.",

These are your people, you big beautiful burner!\r\nThere will be an art video/photo project being created, for posting on the internet after the event, which shows all of the variety of bodies we radically accept on the playa, not just the models that can make the director's cut for the \"Places you'll go\" video. Come and get your body painted as our artist sees fit and take a step to show off your radical self love!\r\nThere will be Sonoma County Sangria served at the Thirsty Camel bar and a multi-media dance extravaganza inside the dome.

But at the Black Rock City Museum of Transportation History, we explore the fictional story of fictional transportation in a fictional historical Black Rock City.  Learn about how burners got around the Playa before bikes ruled and art cars amazed.  See pictures, models, and artifacts gathered since Black Rock City's fictional founding nearly 150 years ago.  Hear from a guide, or if we're not around, take a self-guided tour.  Perhaps most importantly, tell us your own stories, or perhaps your grandmother's, about BRC's fictional transportation past!\r\n\r\nWe'll be open during the day (lunchtime to dinnertime) starting on Monday.  Our big gala takes place on Wednesday night at 9pm--it's Burner black tie.  Come find us on 9:00 near Desiderata!  Hope to see you.",

No more unlikely than a deaf composer.  -- To create the Black Rock City Philharmonic (a five-year project), we need: 1) section leaders in San Francisco, New York, Western Canada, and Eastern Canada; 2) a bank of Burn-ready instruments; 3) a network of veteran burners who are also skilled musicians; and 4) a road map to guide us to our performance, three or four years down the road. Musicians, enthusiasts, roadies, visionaries, and realists are all welcome to talk about how to bring Beethoven to the playa.  Join us for the inaugural meeting of the Black Rock City Philharmonic, to be held at the Golden Cafe in the French Quarter.",

Come join in an interactive workshop that will explore the shadow side of John Frum including the negative impact of colonialism, the glorification of material objects, the destruction of native lands and culture, America's lack of responsibility for military endeavors, and the current impact of this Cargo Cult story. This workshop will explore our shared reality of how racism, classism, and sexism affect our current Burning Man community. We welcome people of all backgrounds to this workshop and to this exploration of how the oppression we were taught in every day society plays out on playa. We will explore the difficulties of the current paradigm and how that affects our ability to form a new experimental community. There will be space to address how we as the BM community want to create change on and off playa.",

You've seen feats of skill on the Playa, and who hasn't dreamed of running off to join the Circus. Heck, half of y'all probably still dream in acrobats and clowns.  At Circus Boot Camp, we'll teach you to juggle, unicycle, hoop, slack line, trapeze, crack a whip and indulge your childish fancy in other circus-inspired arts.\r\n\r\nI know what you're thinking: \"Sure, you'll teach me to juggle... after I've spent years on the road washing elephants and dodging monkey poop!\" Wrong! Our goal is nothing less than to bring the joys of object manipulation, unicycling and other circus arts to the Playa masses in a casual, friendly and fully clothed environment (ok, mostly-clothed).\r\n\r\nAlready a circus pro? Come test your mettle on our slackline; dance your clown shoes through the obstacles of irony; pass clubs with seasoned semi-professionals; try your hand at the Valley of One-Wheeled Doom!!",

They brought in spaceships with supplies, did a little bit of genetic engineering and started what we know as modern civilization. Then they left without a trace. Without its force field, the spaceport reverted to basic elements. In other words, it dissolved.\r\n\r\nThe ancient people of that time did everything to try to call back the aliens and their spaceships. They built spaceports, called henges out of wood, to no avail. They even built a spaceport out of stone. Its remains can be found in Southern England and is known today as Stonehenge. Still no Aliens came. They were missing the technology they did not understand.\r\n\r\nWell, we have figured it out. They were missing a beacon. Without a Quantum Transducer acting as a subspace beacon the alien spaceships have nothing to home in on. Well, we have fixed that. We built one. In fact, the entire spaceport is one giant beacon, shining like a lighthouse in the subspace frequencies.\r\n\r\nAt 11:00 p.m. on Wednesday night, we will turn on our subspace Quantum Transducer. A spaceship will appear and Johnfrum will return to Earth. He will bring us a message of peace and friendship. He will once again return to Earth and live with us in harmony.\r\n\r\nWe will welcome him with wine, women, music and dance. So be at Camp Tetrion and its Spaceport for the festivities. This will be the real deal! Rejoice! Johnfrum will come back at long last!",

        "description": "Contradancing all levels every night to live music - looped/ traditional/ celtic/ fusion/ techno; fast-paced yet easy to learn with a caller who instructs (but with room for dancers to improvise). Half the moves are with your partner, half with everyone else - so it has a tribal vibe, where the Zen is flow, synchrony, and bonding (not footwork, not competition). The repeated cycles of movement give dancers a long time to catch on.  In any case if you are smiling you are doing it right.  Dancers adjust their behavior to each new dancer they come to and gently realign fellow dancers if needed making contradancing one of the most accessible group dance forms, with for example mentally disabled, blind, deaf and wheelchair bound dancers at many dances.  Friendly to children and adults carrying children.  Sunset - midnightish (later if everyone keeps going), except Sat starts 30 min after the man falls, Sun starts 60 min after the temple burn begins.  Go to website to 'taste' dancing (including headcam video) and music.",

This year's configuration will see 4 circles of six effigies placed around the base of the Man that will burn together on Thursday night at exactly 9pm to create the world's largest intentional simultaneous Burn!\r\n\r\nGuided by the Ten Principles, CORE teams work together throughout the Spring and Summer to create art that celebrates their Regional identities and showcases the collaborative artistic efforts of their community members. The CORE Project is a celebration of Burning Man's Regional Network and of the work that groups throughout the world are doing to nurture and support the Burning Man ethos as a global cultural movement.\r\n\r\n2013's Circle of Regional Effigies will include the highest number of international Regional groups to date with groups from Taiwan, Israel, The Netherlands, Lithuania, Czech Republic, and France joining the circle.\r\nIf you are joining us on the playa, visit the Everywhere Pavilion on the Esplanade to get placement maps, and read more info about each effigy, meet with Regional Contacts and CORE artists and collaborators.\r\nIn the meantime, please read about the pieces on the Burning Man website, so you can understand them better, and enjoy them that much more during your time in BRC.\r\n\r\n•••Tour de CORE Monday 7-10pm•••\r\nThere will be a TOUR DE CORE Celebration of the Regional Effigies on Monday evening. This is the time to come out to the CORE project and visit with the creators and builders and see what they have to share with you about their projects.

Instead of meeting in the halls to talk about how \"great the burn was this year,\" and how “we should meet up next year,” let's get together on the Playa to celebrate our amazing community and the unique institution that we call home. PCC Professor Richard Tarnas will give an enlightening talk on the historical role of “heroic communities” in transforming the world (like CIIS and Burning Man). Wear your best Playa fashions, bring your friends and family, and maybe even get some ideas for your next academic paper. Let’s elevate “school spirit” to a new dimension while we enjoy each other outside of our default roles.

However, for this art work for Burning Man, there is a cap on the number of people participating due to the specific concept of the work.\r\nWe are asking for a photograph because we want to have a wide range of body types and skin tonalities represented in the final work. Although everyone is unique, If you are not chosen, it is simply because we may have reached the amount of people with similar specific characteristics. We apologize in advance if you are not chosen for this particular idea but please do not let it deter you from posing in future works by Spencer where there are no number limits.\r\n\r\nChosen participants will be contacted by email prior to August 24th with: location and further instructions. Please only sign up if you are committed to participating and able to wake up before sunrise (or stay up all night). The work will take place before sunrise in order to utilize the pre-dawn light. You will be in position when the sun rises.\r\n\r\nYou only will be nude for a short period of time. \r\n...we know it's chilly...so you will not be nude until right before the sun rises over the horizon and as the sun hits your body. 5am is just the call time to get you registered.  We need everyone to be on time.  In exchange for taking part, you will receive by mail, a limited edition print of the art work. PARTICIPANTS ONLY. \r\nThank-you!",

( please fill in location as we have not been assigned a space yet)\r\n\r\nWe finally found a solid use for white bread; it’s the perfect building block. If you’ve ever wondered about the compressive strength of a 10 day old loaf, make a point to come by and marvel at this free-standing enclosed structure. The material for this abode can be grown in one growing season and has an insulation value of R-5. The inspiration for this 10 foot diameter Dome of Dough is the traditional beehive shape of the charcoal kilns in Death Valley.\r\n\r\nCrawl inside, wonder at the meditative vibe and who knows, maybe there will be fresh bread and jam for snacking.\r\n\r\nWARNING: HI Gluten Zone!\r\n\r\nSubmitted by Howie Hawkes, AKA Hawkster, howie@hawkesconstruction.com",

You'll discover that you have all the resources you need to keep your body healthy and your mind at peace, using these simple, yet profound movements.  Jump, tap, shake, sway, and breath yourself into a state of tranquility & health.  There will be an emphasis on practical application; this is a workshop and ritual, not a lecture! All are welcome, especially beginners.  Open yourself to the magic coursing within. Qigong is much gentler than most forms of yoga, and a wonderful complement to a vigorous yoga practice.

Combined with the incredible power of the playa's only nuclear reactor, the Siberian Electric Company, the Electric Lazy Lounge is stronger than ever and now capable of transporting participants beyond this universe into other dimensions of time and space.

The\r\nname Holotropic means literally \"moving toward wholeness\" (from the\r\nGreek \"holos\"=whole and \"trepein\"=moving in the direction of something).\r\n\r\nThe process itself uses very simple means: it combines accelerated\r\nbreathing with evocative music in a special set and setting. With the\r\neyes closed and lying on a mat, each person uses their own breath and\r\nthe music in the room to enter a non-ordinary state of consciousness.\r\nThis state activates the natural inner healing process of the\r\nindividual's psyche, bringing him or her a particular set of internal experiences. With the inner healing intelligence guiding the process,\r\nthe quality and content brought forth is unique to each person and for\r\nthat particular time and place. While recurring themes are common, no\r\ntwo sessions are ever alike.",

California is one of many Granges throughout the country that are supporting a return of agriculture to local farming, organics, sustainable practices, alternative energy and localization of living and working.  We actively support the arts, music, education, youth and engage in a variety of community service projects.\r\n\r\nCalifornia Grange is on the forefront of revitalizing this organization that was founded after the Civil War by family farmers who opposed domination by big banks and railroads that controlled markets and prices. \r\n\r\nCorporatocracy is ever more powerful and many Granges actively oppose it.\r\n\r\nCome learn about the Grange and how we work to create relevant communities whether urban or rural rooted in family and friendship.",

We will together invoke the Divine Feminine in Her profoundly deep, naked, authentic, healing, initiatic role in order to give birth to our cosmic, true nature.  We have been fascinated and passionately exploring the Art of the Sacred Union for years, studying the tantric teachings of Kashmir Saivism tradition, Kaula lineage, Dasha Mahavidya system, Sufi mysticism, sexual shamanism, and occidental esoteric alchemy and psychology.

These agents provided the transcendent space that allowed inner wounds to be reconfigured into a more manageable and workable form, releasing the soul from inner/outer conflict.\r\n\r\nExperiences with three different entheogenic agents enabled me to access states of consciousness that fostered healing in my familial relationships by re-framing conflicts, through form of visions and wider understandings, in pictorial, mythological, and transcendent narratives. These experiences in the Other Worlds have been translated into substantial and concrete shifts in the Ordinary World.\r\n\r\nThis journey through the ‘immaterial' considers entheogenic agents as psychological/emotional catalysts for transformation and growth. The Jungian framework of alchemy and individuation has been central in filtering my transformational process and the focus is on its relevance to integrating psychedelic explorations.",

Those seeking a ride via Love Potion/Amphora Art Car have the option of meeting at Camp Manifestation (9:35&E) at 5:00pm-5:15pm.\r\n\r\nYou are invited to wear your playa best and join us for a champagne toast after the ceremony.\r\n\r\nA Side Note: If you have never been to the trash fence you may think we are crazy to have such a special ceremony at such a strange place. Well we are crazy but you will soon understand why the trash fence sounds like rubbish to some and magic to others…\r\n\r\nWhy Burning Man? Crazy right!?\r\nWhy yes we are! And since BM is where we met, it seemed the most perfect place for us to get married. There is NO obligation to attend. If you can join us, we'd love to have you! We are so happy to have a wedding without seating arrangements so the MORE the MERRIER!",

It comprises a new somatic modality for reanimating the body with its improvisatory flow and playful exploratory freedom. Supported on a massage table with your body borne aloft on the continually moving fulcrum of the practitioner’s body, the receiver is moved through a wide range of extended postures.  Using a suite of practiced movements, such as pivoting his body under different joints of your body, the giver is able to move the receiver seamlessly and weightlessly throughout the course a session. He safely levers the receiver’s body into increasingly extended and pleasurable positions that combine deep hip opening, pivoting and spinal decompression that, collectively, evoke a deep state of surrender.",

Using brainwave-oracles to channel mental energy, the supplicants invoke the Tesla-Jinn and energize the cargo ritual, producing a fiery prayer-ring-of-hands, circling overhead faster and faster, and as the coil begins to energize a hoary crown of high voltage discharge develops a dome of plasma, arcing and sparking wildly, as the electromagnetic prayer is transmitted out into the heavens, and as the transubstantiation is at zenith the distant sound of approaching Voices can be heard, building in volume as a host of heavily-laden, ground-shaking, cargo-bearing bird machines bears down on the encampment, growing louder and louder until the thunderous, throbbing drone of a chorus of engines shakes the tower and brings an eruption of devotional energy as precious cosmic cargo rains down upon the blessed worshipers of dust and fire. Weather permitting.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to strap on a brainwave \"oracle\" and watch the monitor as you control your brainwaves and fire the flame cannons, invoking the \"Cosic Cargo Routine\".\r\n\r\nBrain cleansing services may be available throughout the day but we cannot commit to being properly staffed except on the posted time and date.

Shed of your clothes, you lay prone and robbed of your sense of sight, our artists perform upon your body with the music in ways that you have never experienced. Pleasing aromas will further enhance your experience of this unique and creative custom designed sensory performance. Not for the faint of heart. This is a one on one, sensual adult event. Space is very limited so signing up for a session prior to start time is highly recommended. Check at The Amazing Illumelodie Dome inside Silicon Village for more info and added times.",

YOU! \r\nAnd we're here to fix that. Like a chiropractor who adjusts your body, we adjust your life emotionally, mentally and spiritually, helping you see what's holding you back and giving you the tools to create the life you want.\r\n\r\nCamp IMAGINEnation is a life coaching camp dedicated to the power of dreaming and radical honesty. Our Life Coaches are trained in The Handel Method and go through an extensive 2-year or more training process on life issues and human behavior. \r\n\r\nCamp IMAGINEnation was founded by The Handel Group and born of an authentic and ambitious desire to change the world in a very positive way. It is a spiritual endeavor for us. We think that those who are willing to dig deep and look at themselves honestly are the most courageous people in the world, not to mention, people we’d want to hang with. In a word, we are looking to make personal development cool. We think it is. \r\n\r\nThe Handel Method was developed over the last 15 years by HG Co-founder and Chairman, Lauren Zander. The method is the foundation for not only our life coaching work, but also for the courses we teach at MIT, NYU, Rutgers and Stanford Business Schools, and for the work we do within large companies in the Executive Coaching Division. The method is revolutionary yet easy to understand, methodical yet infinitely customizable. Most importantly of all, it has proven to be highly effective.\r\n\r\nTogether we dig deep, play big and don’t stop until goals are fulfilled and lessons learned. We care, we love what we do and we walk our talk.",

Come for an early hour of low impact exercise  in the Longevity Stick Art (LSA) discipline of 12 low-impact exercises  \r\nto build balance, flexibility, strength, mental focus, breathing capacity, and vitality, and open your points and channels. Bring your water or hydration liquid. We’ll have sticks available for you. Master Mai Bac Dao developed the Longevity Stick Art discipline while he was a prisoner of war of the North Vietnamese Army. He helped his fellow  prisoners restore and maintain their health through LSA, and vowed that if he was ever freed, he would dedicate his life to spreading its benefits to the world, with the proviso that no future trainer could ever charge for the course. (Sounds like \"gifting,\" eh?) He was freed, settled in Southern California, and started teaching classes of students and future teachers. Today, there are dozens of classes weekly around So Cal. Also, LSA is spreading around the US and world.  \r\nMany more details are available at:  HYPERLINK \r\n\"http://www.longevitystick.org/Longevitystick.org/Home.html \" www.longevitystick.org/Longevitystick.org/Home.html and  HYPERLINK \"http://www.filmbaby.com/films/2341 \"  \r\nMaster Dao passed away late 2010 at age 89, and I was privileged to attend his funeral, and his last birthday party, a few months before.",

Gravity central.Grounding is a vital component of daily balanced living. It allows us to deepen our connection with mother earth, or Gaia, and source energy. It teaches us how to release stress, stay focused, clear the chatter from our minds and auric fields, and eliminate free radicals from our bodies. When we connect with Gaia, we begin to realize that we are all safe and well provided for. We learn to understand our greater truths and to let go of fear, anger, guilt and anxiety. This allows us to establish a connection with our divine authentic self.\r\n\r\nWhether you are a seasoned meditator or novice, you are invited to experience an ancient Eastern meditation breathing technique that has been passed on from master to master for centuries to achieve self-enlightenment. In this workshop you will learn about the chakra system, with an emphasis on the root, sacral and solar plexus. Our chakras govern our life force energy as well as our glandular, mental and emotional systems. Through the use of sage, crystals and sound we will also start to understand basic cleansing of our auric field and our surroundings. We will utulize ancient grounding techniques and a guided meditation to establish our connection with Gaia, help transform our outlook, and feel more grounded in our everyday lives.",

It is the celebration of the masculine/feminine essence we enjoy so much!\r\n- Hair or Make Up will be available prior to the show for participants who show up early enough\r\n- A sense of rhythm helps but simply moving works just fine\r\n\r\nCome early and stay late for the Men's Lingerie Review in the Dungeon. Same models, sans outerwear. Models, bring your lace thongs, your hosiery, corsets and the pieces that make you feel sexy all under!\r\n\r\nDuring the shows, Retrofolic will offer delicious alcohol and non-alcohol beverages. Lights of color, art of goth and kink will treat your eyes. Music of tribal and trance, multiple scenes with howls of delight, moans of agony and screams of extremes will fill your ears in the 1600 feet squared dungeon space next door!",

According to wikipedia, Pure miso paste nutritional information: Although high in sodium (over 400% DV), one cup (275 g) of miso paste is an excellent source of dietary fiber (59%) and protein (64% DV), as well as a good source of minerals . Miso paste is also high in amino acids, the basic building blocks of protein. An excellent source of vitamin K and a decent source of riboflavin (38% DV), miso also provides small amounts of other vitamins. One major benefit of miso is its extremely high omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid content. We believe Miso saves Burners life on the Playa and leave them with good health all day.",

This helps in cooling you down, and it highly increases the entertainment value of the game. \r\nCome for a snow cone in the afternoon at the Contraptionists and stay for the fun of the game:\r\nNAKED WET TWISTER at 2-3pm, more games may be scheduled in the afternoon, if the crowd desires!",

She will share some useful tools that can maximize our experience, as well as what we can learn, in those inner voyages. Non- ordinary states of consciousness can come with their own sets of 'superpowers', operating principles and potential pitfalls. Knowing how to use those forces for expansion, and alignment, can not only occasionally save you from 'the inner gates of hell', but also bring accelerated growth, ecstatic experiences, and a deep feeling of connectedness with yourself, others, and the world. Through lecture, sharing, and experiential exercises she will enrich your psychonaut- toolkit, and activate and empower your inner shaman.",

        "description": "This offering will be a combination of lecture and dialogue on the topic of open (non-monogamous) relationship as a path of awakening. Open relationships, and/or polyamory, are becoming more widely known to the general public as an alternative to the default cultural model of monogamous relationships. One of the first questions that comes up for someone when they first hear about open relationship is \"Why?\" Why would anyone choose this model of relationship? Certainly at the beginning of someone's exploration of open relationship (and often for sometime to come), it would seem a guaranteed way to bring up ones deepest fears and insecurities. So why do it? \r\n\r\nWe will talk about open relationships and explore answers to these questions, from an unlikely frame, that of spiritual awakening. In my opinion, not only is open relationship compatible with a deep path of spiritual awakening, it may be one of the most profound ways to catalyze and walk that path.",

Take a walk through your house (or Burning Man camp) from plastic-packaged food in the kitchen to toothbrushes and shampoo in the bathroom, our world is full of plastic.  And at Burning Man, we are sleep in plastic sleeping bags in plastic tents and wear plastic goggles.  And how much of our food and water is packaged in plastic? Although some plastics make our lives better, much of it is a problem -- polluting our oceans and beaches and harming our health with toxic chemicals. But what can one person do to be part of the solution? Join us for inspiring stories and practical tips to reduce plastic in your home and on the Playa.  Author Beth Terry will share her journey from self-confessed plastic addict to empowered plastic-free activist and explain why we can't just recycle our way out of this mess.  You may even get to peek at her (nearly) plastic-free campsite.",

This is an introduction to the amazingly effective, simple and ground-breaking work of Jon Connelly in restoring victims of severe trauma, including sexual violence and war veterans, to full function. (See rapidtrauma.com for more information).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe morning workshop will outline the content of an average session, and explain the principles at work that allow for rapid resolution. Attendees will benefit personally by tapping into the human mind’s power to heal and restore proper function after trauma – which is defined as anything stored in the human mind in a dysfunctional way.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe afternoon session will ask for volunteers to do a session, free of charge, with an audience observing. Life-changing, all will gain insights that will benefit them in their life and lead to a brighter, lighter, more peaceful and exciting life.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nClass is taught by David Monroe, who has been a “scout” of healing technologies for years, and is certified in Rapid Trauma Resolution training.",

This is an introduction to the amazingly effective, simple and ground-breaking work of Jon Connelly in restoring victims of severe trauma, including sexual violence and war veterans, to full function. (See rapidtrauma.com for more information).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe morning workshop will outline the content of an average session, and explain the principles at work that allow for rapid resolution. Attendees will benefit personally by tapping into the human mind’s power to heal and restore proper function after trauma – which is defined as anything stored in the human mind in a dysfunctional way.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe afternoon session will ask for volunteers to do a session, free of charge, with an audience observing. Life-changing, all will gain insights that will benefit them in their life and lead to a brighter, lighter, more peaceful and exciting life.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nClass is taught by David Monroe, who has been a “scout” of healing technologies for years, and is certified in Rapid Trauma Resolution training.",

Through chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo an individual is able to awaken this enlightenment the Buddha revealed and reveal their own buddha nature. A practitioner of this buddhism through chanting and study can transform their life and create a state of unshakable happiness overcoming the sufferings of birth and death. Buddhism is a practice and everyone is welcome to join. Each day after chanting together we will study a buddhist concept, answer questions and share experiences about the practice and its application to our daily life. All are welcome to join us even if you have never chanted before.",

Have you been wondering what is Rootism? Have you been wondering what is Rootist & PHY yoga? Well then, wonder no more:The Rootist understands that the path of oneness forks many roads. There are infinite possibilities from which we may choose along the way. It’s the journey.We will learn from our experiences as we evolve as humans, and we may hopefully learn to peel away the layers of illusion fostered by maturity and our life experiences. Through study and inquiry we may also find common threads from the ancient teachings linked to modern expressions of spirituality.We may even sense unity at some point.What is beautiful about life is that there are multiple unique levels of exploration within each of us. Each layer can reveal a different angle or new areas of focus for growth evolving us to become prismatic.Our potential is driven from the main spirit channel, the heart – the keeper of our spark. Our breathing, the spiritus from which the word spirit evolved, is feeding the spark.Self-Awareness happens when we identify and tap into the roots of our beliefs with evaluation and reflection.Rootism is the belief that the truth is all around us always yet often hidden like a gem in the rough waiting for us to discover it with great enthusiasm.",

Do you want to reduce the amount of recycling you will have to pack out? Start by separating your your recyclables from any landfill trash. Then separate all your aluminum cans and bring them to Black Rock City Recycle Camp. We are located in Center Camp at 6:00, directly behind the Cafe. The camp is \"Open\" and ready to accept your cans Monday through Sunday, 9am to 5pm. Bring your clean, separated aluminum cans only. We definitely don't want your trash. We also do not accept any other recyclables, you can take them to one of the 24 hour recycling stations on your way back to Reno, check out your Survival Guide for more information. We provide a sorting area to check your cans for anything that isn't aluminum. Then you can ride the bike powered can crusher and crush your cans. After your cans get crushed, you will put your crushed cans into the large containers at the camp. All proceeds from the aluminum are donated to the Gerlach K-12 School in Gerlach, NV. Come join in the fun while doing a good thing for the planet and Black Rock City..!",

In this workshop we'll share with you what lessons we've learned in drafting, revising, and adhering to our relationship agreement over the years. We'll also engage you in how some of these ideas might be applicable for you and your partner(s).

Upon completion dancers will be able to recognize about 10 move \"calls\" and dance them confidently and joyously. Salsa Rueda (aka \"Casino de Rueda\") is a particular type of circle dancing to Salsa music. It was developed in Havana, Cuba in the late 1950s and early 1960s by the group Guaracheros de Regla. Pairs of dancers form a circle, with dance moves called out by one person, a caller. Many moves involve the swapping of partners creating a fun, synchronized, playful community circle dance.",

Once inside our exclusive event – NO BOTTLE, NO ENTRY – you will partake of Scottish music and nibbles with like-minded desert kiltsmen and women.\r\nSo while spewing feathers in the heat of the day, don’t be a numpty and end up blustered from just any bad swally and scran…  Settle into a little Misfit hospitality and savor the kind of “cargo” cults were actually started over…  You know at least one of the scotches will be spectacular, because you’re going to bring it.\r\nAnd a dram good time will be had by all!\r\n\r\nEntry requires a bottle of unique single malt scotch (no blends) , where you'll join other like-minded fans for a once-in-a-playa tasting they'll write bagpipe songs about.",

Special attention will be paid to balancing out all the stimulation the Playa offers your nervous system. This soothing, grounding, mellow yoga practice will be accessible for yogis of all levels.  \r\n\r\nPlease bring a mat, as well as a sarong, towel, scarf or belt.\r\n\r\nWe'll meet behind the Temple, as to enjoy the peace it attracts as well as the beauty of the landscape beyond our fair city.\r\n\r\nBritt Fohrman fell in love with yoga in 1993 and has been teaching since 1997. While her foundation is rooted in the Iyengar lineage, a 10 year struggle with chronic illness inspired her to go deeply into Restorative Yoga, Viniyoga and Buddhism. Having studied therapeutic yoga and movement with many of the leaders in the field, Britt still believes it's her own healing journey, as well as that of her students, that has taught her the most. Along with her steadfast belief in the healing power of yoga, Britt brings resourcefulness and warmth to her classes. Her style of teaching emphasizes individualized alignment, meditative focus and breath guided movement; imbued with levity, compassion and honesty. She encourages you to step out of your head, into your body and on a yoga journey that supports you wherever you are. One of Britt's specialties lies in working with childbearing women, where she also employs her talents as a photographer, doula, childbirth educator and bodyworker. A passionate adventurer and athlete, Britt spends most of her free time traveling, surfing, hiking with her dog and dancing with the performance art group Billion Jelly Bloom. (Who she's camping and performing with on the Playa)\r\n\r\nFind out more about Britt and her practice at www.brittfohrman.com.",

        "description": "The now infamous camp challenge is back. With origins dating all the way back to the 1980s, this camping tradition has morphed into something truly monstrous. During the heat of the day, in triple digit temperatures, one must eat a helping of five-alarm chili, cooked with the dreaded Guatemalan insanity pepper (grown only by the inmates of a Guatemalan insane asylum). Then, to wash it down, a shot of hot pepper vodka, also infused with the same insanely hot pepper. Now, when you want nothing more than an ice-cold beverage to quench the fire burning in your mouth, you instead must chug a cheap, warm beer that's been sitting out in the sun since daybreak. Why, might you ask, would anyone want to do this? Hell if we know! It's a terrible idea! It's a horrible thing to conceive, much less do on purpose! Yet, as demonstrated by the droves of people who participated AND completed the challenge in past years, we apparently underestimated human nature. Not only did crowds show up for the challenge, but they returned over the course of the week to to share the pain with their friends. And by share, we mean point and laugh while grown men cried and stumbled down the street in a daze. We even had a university anthropologist come hangout, just to observe this odd aspect of human behavior.  We're bringing it back spicier than ever for 2013!",

We've got 10,000 watts of juicy sound, some of the best real estate in Black Rock City, and a nighttime crowd just waiting to be whipped into a frenzy. All you have to do is wow our panel of judges and you too could be headlining Burning Man! For this contest we hearken back to that seminal masterpiece of talent programs: The Gong Show. Perhaps you remember the cringe-worthy showcase of questionable performances that critics could halt by striking a loud gong. This event is eerily similar, only ours has balls. Ovaries too. Giant, dusty gonads. Can you hang? Instead of a gong, DJs will wear a shock collar and get buzzed off stage by volts of harsh rejection if they fail to impress. Instead of regaling us with tap dancing, DJs break out their most mind blowing tracks and slickest tricks. Instead of a paltry sum to commemorate victory, winners will be invited back during peak hours to pound the dance floor into submission. This is open decks for the fearless. Bring it.",

        "description": "We offer spankings to all walks of life so long as you are 18 years of age or older (we reserve the right to ask for ID). We will have a variety of spanking stations and implements to use if bare handed is not your style. Once you have had your fill of spankings you may return to the street or you can come on back to the legendary Xanadome and chill out and relax. Have a drink if you'd like and a freshly baked cookie to reward yourself for a good spanking.  For the curious here is a quick FAQ on spanking.       1) How hard do I have to get spanked.  ANSWER: how hard do you want to be spanked?       2) How many swats do I need to receive to get a cookie?  ANSWER: At least one.    3) I am diabetic/not hungry/gluten intolerant/etc. and do not want a cookie, just a spanking is that okay?     ANSWER: Absolutely, you do not have to receive a cookie to get a spanking, but you must get a spanking to get a cookie.           4) Can I spank you?    ANSWER:  Ask us, we may or may not let you. Cuteness and snuggly bribery or swag works well.        5) I want my partner/friend to spank me instead of you, is that okay.     ANSWER: Of course. Please remember we want to keep you in your comfort zone.     6) Does it have to be bare bottom spanking or is that optional?    ANSWER:  That is completely up to your comfort zone. We will accommodate your limits.",

It is a simple, powerful moving meditation that anyone – of any age, size, or physical ability - can practice. There are no steps to follow, no choreography to learn, no way to do it wrong. The only requirement is a body that is still breathing, a heart that is still beating, and mind that is still curious! Just like light, sound or ocean waves, a dancing body when moving freely passes through five distinct rhythmic patterns. These patterns continuously repeat themselves in a wave of motion. The 5Rhythms are: FLOWING – the fluid, continuous, grounded glide of our own movements STACCATO – the percussive, pulsing beat that shapes us a thousand different ways CHAOS – the rhythm of letting go, releasing into the catalytic wildness of our dance that can never be planned or repeated LYRICAL – the rhythm of trance, where the weight of self-consciousness dissolves, where we lighten up and disappear into our own uniqueness STILLNESS – the quiet emptiness, where gentle movements rise and fall, start and end, in a field of silence Please join RhythmWave as we return to the Black Rock City for our seventh year with this gorgeous dance/meditation practice that we love to share with you!",

You will experience your partner’s love and trust in a new and profound way. Learn how to use these powerful skills and movements to create a new and exciting level of intimacy that deepens the physical, spiritual, and emotional aspects of your sacred connection.  We will explore couple-hood as a yogic path to realization, letting go of the mind and surrendering to the heart through your lover. It is a practice of using your two-ness to realize oneness.  Yoga and Qigong are like brother and sister. Both are esoteric, alchemical practices that were created for self-realization, with exercise being a secondary benefit. Qigong is much gentler than most forms of yoga, and a wonderful compliment to a vigorous yoga practice. Both practices have a common source, Neolithic shamanic practices, and both are ancient books of wisdom written in the language of the body. We'll physically explore the connection between these 2 books of wisdom within the context of your love relationship. We are channeling the sexual and creative energies of the body through visualization, movement, ritual, and breath, not sexual activity. Tantric Qigong is an intimate practice of being gentle with oneself and weaving one's own sexual energy, becoming truly receptive.",

On a deeper level, it will draw on the very values of Burning Man, whose Ten Principles (radical inclusion, gifting, de-commodification, radical, self-reliance, radical self-expression, communal effort, civic responsibility, leaving no trace, participation, and immediacy) will provide touchstones for the speakers in their talks.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is in the spirit of the 10 Principles, TEDxBlackRockCity aims to be more than merely a staged performance. For it is intended, above all, to foster creativity among all of its remarkable participants — both on stage and off — drawing on the uniquely dynamic community of Burning Man to concoct an exemplar of that fertile soup churning with creative sparks.\r\n\r\nPlease join us for an exciting day at Play)A(Skool and the new Aspire \"Learning Center\" --- a collaborative interactivity zone created by Play)A(Skool, IDEATE and La Calaca.",

Participants will learn how to access and sustain the energy, and be trained on how to give and receive energetic squeezes. This exchange of power contributes to aligning the Djed, invigorating the Chakras, and awakening the Kundalini. Participants will leave being present to their super powers and their connectedness to the Oneness. Come with a squeezing buddy or find one there.",

You’ll discover the possibility of reconnection with your innate beauty, wholeness and be honest with yourself and and with others in a safe circle of love. You can discover those places you’ve felt stuck, while you are supported in letting go. You learn to become aware of those times when you get in your own way, and come to see the choices open to you. You embrace what you desire the most, and deeply commit to letting your dreams and your visions be more important than you past wounds. You will find yourself reconnecting with your innate beauty, wholeness and power in each moment.\r\n\r\nHeart of Now workshops include numerous assistants to support you and to create a sacred space for transformation. A deeply nurturing environment is created. This teamwork approach deepens the experience of service and camaraderie, where all are able to experience their vulnerabilities, allowing trust and growth.

Three years ago we took everything we had learned and completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and we gave it a new name: The Orgasamator. This year we’ve taken it that much further with a singular goal of maximizing our guests’ overall pleasure, along with the comfort and sensuality of the environment. When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience in an environment that is safe, comfortable and private, and which leaves you feeling completely respected and in control. Come solo, or better yet, bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. You can wear as much or as little as you would like while riding this marvelous machine, and you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, the Orgasamator Experience at our I-Scream Parlour is something you won't want to miss. Visit us at the Camp for Sensual Pleasures, in Spanky’s Village, and also ask about The Pope’s Massage & Hair washing.",

There are things which can be erotic, silly, or basic than the touch that leads to tickling. Tickling is a great way to explore a new avenue of fun and intimacy with your partner. It can be light, it can be soft, or it can be heavy and sadistic. \r\n\r\nWe will cover many aspects of tickling from playing with others, simple bondage techniques, wrestling, common toys you can use to make your partner cry out in fits of laughter, to discussions of how it can spice up your sex life.  We will cover some aspects of BDSM for the full spectrum of tickling fun.  In addition we will cover the proper etiquette for playing with someone new to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n There will also have a tickle challenge for the most ticklish man and woman attending the event. Those two will be tickled by our event  coordinators, the partner, and whomever else the person is comfortable with. The person who lasts the longest of tickle torment will win a cool prize and be crowned tickle king or queen of Black Rock City.\r\n\r\nYou must be 18 years of age or older to attend this event. This event is best suited for those with a partner. If you do not have a partner that does not mean you cannot attend. We cannot guarantee you will have a partner to play with, but we will try and match you up with someone or one of our instructors.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo be respectful of others and their boundaries. Just remember we are all here for fun, and we have at least two things in common. We are interested/curious about tickling and we are all burners.",

Chill music, slow moves and having a good time is what the goal is here. Cuddle Puddles welcomed. No real wild dancing on this night just a relaxed sail with a group of lovers cuddled up for some top secret fun.\r\nCouples are encouraged to join us. Once the flight deck is full we will be setting sail for the entire evening. Plan ahead with water, warmth, and snacks (wink). We will stop by rest rooms here and there but PLAN AHEAD!!!!\r\nBring your childhood spirit and join us for the first ever Aircraft Carrier Flight Deck Slumber Party.",

Twelve participants were interviewed and a thematic content analysis was conducted on the data, revealing the following overarching themes: Interpersonal relationships with the numinous, spiritual beings, and human beings are fostered; occurrence of transformative intrapersonal experiences; electronic dance music and its effects on the mind and body serve as a catalyst for experiences of transpersonal phenomena; experiences of a spiritual and mystical nature transpire; emphasis placed on the significance of set and setting. Findings suggest that having experiences of transpersonal phenomena at EDM events enhances health and wellbeing in day-to-day life.",

For our third incarnation the TBE~WaVe~ installation, our body~sonic dance platforms that afford participants a uniquely interactive experience to engage kinesthetically with the music, we are upping the visual ante with the addition of a 30ft. dome to our public frontage. This structure, which will be combined with our wave sculpture, will be curated by the visualist CINEMOEBA, who, as per his 2012 work, will once again be providing a wonderland of analog feedback & other projected delights. This in combination with our live fusion and  Dubstep centric line-up featuring some of the finest bass culture talent available on playa, denizens of Black Rock City can expect a fourth dimensional EXPERIENCE like no other. Come wobble the TBE~WaVe~ and challenge your perceptions of bass culture music from every learning and thinking modality. Discover the optimal conditions for proper bass culture appreciation, the facilitation of which is our primary mission. We are devoted to ensuring the Tsunami Bass well~spring of proper bass culture on playa is properly nurtured and celebrated at Burning Man.

We invite you to open your heart/mind and try a new \"substance over style\" attuned environment, carefully curated by bass culture artists (Established by the Tsunami Bass Experience's Morphous & ShiZaru) for artists & aficionados.

In the Enchanted Forest we are always having big lovely orgies with our friends. We like orgies, and we are always horny!! At burningman we are having a stampede, taking our unbridled joy and annoyingly perky enthusiasm across the playa. Join us! We will be galloping around making a nuisance of ourselves, stampeding through people's camps spreading our intolerably positive energy throughout the festival. We will start at 6.30pm, and then stampede around who knows where as the sun sets. We will provide horns to those who are horn deficient. We really can't wait to meet you! Squeeeee!",

Most forms of energy healing, such as Reiki, utilize the energy of manifested life. However, Vortex makes use of divine light and energy, which is more powerful, and can work more deeply, than the energy of manifested life alone. Vortex utilizes 49 different kinds of divine light that serve various functions, including energizing, clearing, purifying, releasing, etc. Finally, all of these forms of divine light are guided by divine consciousness, which brings the deepest power of transformation, i.e. healing separation consciousness. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will feature two Omega-level practitioners of VortexHealing® Divine Energy Healing who will facilitate a small group healing on a topic to be determined at the time of the workshop. Space will be limited to about 15 people.",

Each rhythm focuses on a simple movement quality rather than a specific form or set of steps, giving everyone the freedom to move in ways that feel authentic without any pressure to get it right. With a little instruction, the experience of the 5Rhythms opens us deeply and helps us move beyond self-consciousness to an authentic connection to our body and life force. Using the discipline of each rhythm and the breath as a catalyst for movement, you will be invited to embody, follow, express, and release your own energy. In the end, you will find yourself renewed and reconnected to your own self, feeling fully alive.",

Since popping up the laptop and logging on isn’t an option, we’ll just have ourselves an addiction party instead.\r\n\r\nOpen to all everyone, gamer or not, we’ll have a little gathering Saturday afternoon. Anyone who has completed our daily quests, or just wants to hang out and get their fix is welcome. Our resident mad alchemist has come up with some special brews, and servings of delicious chocolate cake are available to all. If any of our \"Dragonbreath\" chili remains, it’s a great time to polish that off. Hang out, drink some \"kungaloosh\", take down a \"sulfuron slammer\", and swap war stories of \"How I wiped the 40 man raid\".",

        "description": "Also known as yogic sleep or sleep with awareness, Yoga Nidra is an ancient tantric practice that is intended to induce full-body relaxation and a deep meditative state of consciousness. \r\nTraditionally done in a lying down position Yoga Nidra is a systematic method of complete relaxation, holistically addressing our physiological, neurological, and subconscious needs.\r\nGuided imagery and body scan techniques are used to take the practitioner into a deeply relaxed yet aware state. The practice will last 30 minutes. The practitioner begins by quieting the overactive conscious mind, then moves into a meditative state called pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses), gradually finding a state of “ultimate harmony,” in which the brain waves slow down and a subtle euphoria emerges.",

All manifestations of the feminine are invited to join in this practice that will help you tone, open and tune into the pelvic floor, while connecting us with the vast array of pleasurable possibilities in this yummy part of our bodies. In addition to igniting the strength, suppleness and juiciness of our bodies, we'll also gather inspiration from each other to manifest our most wild, uninhibited, embodied and instinctual selves, bringing that energy into in the ways we move, breathe, dance, create, connect and play on and off the Playa.\r\n\r\nPregnant women of the Playa are especially encouraged to join and will be given appropriate modifications to support their growing bellies and babies.\r\n\r\nNo yoga experience required. You are encouraged to bring a mat, as well as a sarong, towel or scarf.\r\n\r\nMeet behind the Temple (facing away from The Man).\r\n\r\nBritt Fohrman gathers her depth of knowledge of the female reproductive system from over 12 years of work as a birth doula, as well as her expertise as a yoga teacher trained mostly in the Iyengar linage since 1993. Her HypnoBirthing childbirth education training and experience in witnessing peace and ease in birth has inspired her to apply these principles of visualization, meditation, breathing and affirmations to other aspects of women's health, particularly fertility and pelvic health. Her teaching style is warm, patient and focused on supporting each student to connect to the voice and abilities of their own body. In addition to training teachers in yoga for women, Britt has a full yoga teaching schedule that includes all kinds of therapeutic private sessions, Prenatal and Gentle Hatha weekly classes and monthly Restorative Yoga workshops.

In this yoga-for-dancers, expect to focus on stretching those hard working quads and hammies as well as loving up your feet.  Coordinating breath with movement we will find ourselves clearing the previous day's energy and setting intention for the day to come.

Bring a mat or a towel to create a little layer between you and our one of a kind bamboo wood dance floor.  Led by RhythmWave's own Ultra (Julie Boone)",
